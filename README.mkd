# sircc

## Description

`sircc` is an IRC client designed for simplicity and code legibility. It is
written in C for Unix platforms.

`sircc` is currently highly experimental: anything can change at any moment.
It is recommended to build it in debug (`make debug=1`) and to enable core
files on your machine.
